Title of Project: Number Guesser Death Run

Project Description: This winter term for the EECS 1022 class we will be constructing a number guesser app. The app will begin with a menu with buttons asking to start and then several different difficulties ranging from easy to hard. Each difficulty makes it harder to guess by decreasing the amount of time given each round and increasing the range of numbers to guess from. Depending on how long the user takes their score will change, (like kahoot). After losing the game, the app will show the user their high score and other scores in a leaderboard. To make the app more presentable, we will attempt to design the app around a central theme of beyblade. 

Functional Requirements
1. Users will be able to choose which difficulty they want to play on  
2. Users will be able to input a name which the app will add to the leaderboard if necessary 
3. Users will be able to to input a number to guess
4. Users will be able to view other users high scores 
5. Users will be able to choose an avatar from beyblade
6. Highscores will be saved on a file 
7. The game will play background music to help the aesthetic
8. The user will be able to mute the music 
9. the game will automatically end when the user reaches 20 successful guesses in a row
10. Users will be able to view the rules 
11. Game will display a  bar along the bottom which changes from green to orange to red depending on the time the user takes
12. Game will ask the user if  their selection is final (are you sure?)
